Mission
--
This program is designed with my own needs in mind and may not fit every system, although I plan to build it with the flexibility needed to adjust easily.

The purpose of this program is to automatically create a backup (tar to begin with), of my home directory and important files, then split it to fit on 7.9 GB DVD's.

Dependencies
